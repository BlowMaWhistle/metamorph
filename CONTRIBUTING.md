    * It may inspire or influence you for new ideas, or to revise your current one.
2. **Create an issue or discussion where you describe your idea.** If a suitable issue/discussion exists already, carry on from there.<br />
    * We maintain an overview of our work inventory and planning.
    * It will encourage you to think well about what it is you wish to contribute.
    * Others can help you refine and discuss your idea.
    * If for some reason you wish to deviate from this way of working, you are free to do so *at own risk* of rejection.

If your contribution involves making actual changes to the code or documentation, please continue reading.

3. **Make changes to the files on your own fork of the project.** Note that changes to the Wiki are a separate case. Please contact us if that's what you wish to do.
